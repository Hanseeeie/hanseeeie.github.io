<h2>About</h2>
<p>Set in a fantasy world, this story focuses on a trio of 'Greatcoats'. So named because of their trademarked coats - veritable treasure troves of weapons, defences and supplies which can keep them alive for weeks whist travelling.</p>
<p>They were re-formed by the late King in order to study and uphold the King's laws throughout the land - including within the duchies. The dukes and duchesses, used to having their own laws enforced within their respective duchies, banded together to 'remove' the King and disband the Greatcoats.</p>
<p>The world in which we join the story is one where the Greatcoats are seen as both traitors to the duchies and traitors to the King.</p>


<h3>Liked</h3>
<p>Characters! The characters were very well written - each with their own quirks and personalities.</p>

<h4>Falcio val Mond</h4>
<p>As the story follows Falcio val Mond and his journey, it's easy to like his character. He takes charge in a way that feels very dependable, and his two Greatcoat companions Kest and Brasti react to him this way. Falcio has a fierce determination to do what's right, a fierce loyalty to the King and his friends and a fierce love for his wife - everything he does, he does with his heart. He's the true embodiment of the King's Heart (which I think would also have been a lovely name for the book!).</p>

<h4>Kest</h4>
<p>There's not a lot I can say about Kest without ruining the story! Kest has this calm, critical and calculating view of the world. I feel that he sees things in a black or white way - there's no grey area, and only the influence of Falcio and Brasti stop him acting on his own beliefs.</p>

<h4>Brasti</h4>
<p>Brasti is the comic relief in the novel - in a good way! When the tension becomes unbearable (and it will!) you can count on Brasti to make some remark which will have you laughing out loud.</p>

<h4>Valiana</h4>
<p>I found myself instantly drawn to Valiana. I don't know if it's because I didn't trust her or because of the mystery surrounding her. Her character produced a love/hate reaction from me with each passing chapter!</p>

<h4>The Tailor</h4>
<p>Completely mad, completely brilliant and completely frustrating! I hope there's more of her to come.</p>

<h4>The Fey Horse</h4>
<p>The idea of a fabled horse that could understand humans was so exciting to me and I love the poor creature that is Monster.</p>

<h3>Overall</h3>
<p>de Castell's novel hooked me from the get-go with mystery and the promise of a new fantasy world.</p>

<p>It made me laugh, it made me cry, it made me angry, and it made me so incredibly frustrated - but in a good way! It had so many twists and turns I couldn't even begin to guess what would happen, and I was glued to the book until I found out.</p>

<h3>Favourite quote</h3>
<p>'Gods, man, don't you start now,' I said softly. 'We're going to get a terrible reputation if we just keep travelling across the countryside crying all the time.' - p. 361</p>

<p>If you are a fan of adult fantasy, like a bit of mystery, love swordplay and want to experience a great new world filled with diverse characters, then this novel is definitely for you.</p>

<p>Rating 5/5</p>

<p>As I can't wait for the next novel in the series to come out, I'm currently finding out all I can to join the Greatcoats!</p>

<p>My Greatcoat name would be St Joseph Houghton</p>
<p>(Find out yours by combining the name of your first school with the maiden name of your grandmother on your mother's side.)</p>
