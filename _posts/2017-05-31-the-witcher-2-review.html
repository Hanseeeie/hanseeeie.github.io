<p>Recently I've been playing The Witcher 2: Assassins of Kings and I just thought I'd share my feelings on it so far.</p>
<p>Having played the first Witcher almost two years ago and hearing great feedback for the third installment I thought it was long overdue for a playthrough of the second.</p>


<h2>About</h2>
<p>The Witcher games are based on books by Andrzej Sapkowski, a Polish author, and follow the main character Geralt of Rivia who is (you might've guessed it!) a witcher. Witchers are basically monster hunters with some supernatural powers of their own, which is a pretty awesome concept.</p>
<p>There are a lot of politics in the game, between the humans and non-humans (elves and dwarves) and as a witcher (not quite human and not quite non-human) you're stuck in the middle.</p>
<p>As with many RPGs you make choices which impact the story and one of the main choices in The Witcher 2 is who you choose to continue your journey with - Roche, human commander of the Blue Stripes (special forces) or Iorveth, elven commander of a Scioa'tael commando (non-human guerrillas).</p>
<p>For my first playthrough, I chose Roche - for plot reasons! But I definitely want to play both branches, as I'm really enjoying it and want to experience more of the story.</p>

<h3>Likes</h3>
<p>I absolutely love the lore of this world. I think I'll need to read the books at some point, because the witchers, different factions and monsters are all so interesting. On a side note, trolls are adorable!</p>
<p>The magic aspect ties in really well and doesn't feel forced like in some fantasy games. It plays quite a big part in the series (from what I've seen so far) and the way it has been implemented really adds to the immersion.</p>
<p>Speaking of immersion - the environments!! Oh my days, the medieval look of the towns, cities, castles and campsites you visit is just amazing. It just feels realistic. I wouldn't know about the authenticity, but for a fantasy game it really ticked all my boxes. The version I'm playing, the enhanced edition, was released in 2012 and the graphics are obviously not up to current standards, but for me they still look beautiful.</p>
<p>The characters add a lot of depth to the story, with old faces like Triss, Dandelion and Zoltan reappearing from the first game. Even the NPCs have their own routines and dialogue as they potter about their environment.</p>


<h3>Dislikes</h3>
<p>I think I only have one dislike so far and that's the voice acting! I think I struggled with this in the first game as well, which might be why I didn't go straight into the second. Usually I LOVE the voice actors in games, so I feel really guilty saying that I dislike them now, as I know it's a skilled and difficult role. But every time I hear Geralt speak the immersion is broken, it happens a few times with Triss and Dandelion, but mostly it's Geralt. It just sounds like he's reading from a script. I'm not sure if this was an intentional choice for Geralt, as he's meant to be a no-nonsense, plain-talking character, but his voice really lacks emotion and it just comes off as awkward. I'm really hoping they might have improved upon this for the third game, just so it's a bit more enjoyable listening to them speak!</p>


<h3>Overall</h3>
<p>Despite that though, I would still recommend playing The Witcher 2 as it's such an interesting and enjoyable RPG!</p>


<h3>Favourite quotes</h3>
<p>Geralt: "Maybe I'll come back when you're sober."</p>
<p>Cedric: "You witchers live a long life. You may indeed live to see the day."</p>


<p>Thanks for viewing! Happy gaming :)</p>
