<h2>About</h2>
<p>Set thirty years before the events that take place in the game Dragon Age: Origins, this story focuses on two unlikely friends, Maric (a prince) and Loghain (an outlaw), and their contribution to the rebellion of the Orlesian Empire.</p>
<p>The world in which we join the story is one where there isn’t much hope; a rebellion force exists but their leader, the rightful Queen Moira, has just been killed under the false pretence of forming an alliance. Her son, Prince Maric, is now the only hope the rebellions have…but they don’t even know that he’s alive.</p>


<h3>Liked</h3>
<p>Again, the characters. I felt like this story was more character driven than plot driven. We're reading to find out about their back story and the plot is there as a way to show us what happened before the events in the game.</p>

<h4>Prince Maric</h4>
<p>The first character we meet and one of the two POVs we get to experience, Maric is the happy-go-lucky, loveable, accident-prone protagonist. His character was really easy to read and to side with, and I'm all for those who bring comic relief to intense situations. Circumstances lead towards his character becoming that you would expect of a king and, even though he takes on a more serious persona, he doesn't lose his essence. The book begins and ends with an air of sorrow for him.</p>

<h4>Loghain</h4>
<p>The second character whose POV we experience, Loghain is Maric's opposite – they're different sides of the same coin. This character was really difficult for me to read because of the game! I absolutely loathed him in DA:O, but in this I really loved his character. Forced into situations he shouldn't even be part of, Loghain takes everything in his stride, albeit unwillingly, and comes through for Maric each time. His utter loyalty to Maric as the tale unfolds is beautifully written and he quickly became my favourite character of the novel.</p>

<h4>Rowan</h4>
<p>Daughter of Arl Redcliffe, Rowan is a high-ranking warrior and part of the rebellion. I loved her character! As the novel progresses we see that, although she is fierce in battle, she is torn between her duty to fight and protect those she loves with the idea that she has to remain feminine. Her constant loyalty to Maric and Loghain and her will to do what's right really adds to the dynamic of the story.</p>


<h3>Overall</h3>
<p>Having already played the game, I was eager to read about the events which lead up to it and, once I started the first page, it gripped me and wouldn't let go. The characters are engaging, believeable and I found myself feeling emotional for each one as they experienced their own misfortunes. They travel through memorable parts from the game, but the descriptions help bring them alive.</p>

<p>You don't even need to have played the games to enjoy this novel; if you're a fan of fantasy, want a new world to explore and enjoy engaging characters, then try this!</p>

<h3>Favourite quote</h3>
<p>"I fall off horses," he explained to Loghain with a sickly grin. "It's this thing I do."' - p. 98</p>

<p>Thanks for viewing! Happy reading :)</p>
